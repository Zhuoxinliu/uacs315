# Chapter 6: Testing

 - "I can only test my code"
	 - Not true
	 - What can be tested
		 - Code
		 - Design Artifacts
		 - Pretty much everything we make
		 - The testing itself
 - Testing
	 - Two basic types
		 - Execution-based testing
		 - Non-execution-based testing
	 - V & V
		 - Verification: Is the software doing things right?
			 - Determine if the workflow was completed correctly
			 - Ensures the software is designed to deliver all functionality according to the requirements
		 - Validation: Is the software doing the right things?
			 - Determine if the product as a whole satisfies the requirements
			 - Ensures the functionality, as defined by the requirements, is the intended behavior of the software
	 - Software Quality
		 - Not "excellence"
		 - The extend to which the software satisfies its specifications
		 - Every software professional is responsible for ensuring that his or her work is correct
		 - Quality must be built in from the beginning
	 - Software Quality Assurance
		 - The members of the SQA group must ensure that the developers are doing high-quality work
			 - At the end of each workflow
			 - When the product is complete
		 - In addition, quality assurance must be applied to the process itself
			 - Ex. Standards
		 - Managerial Independence
			 - There must be managerial independence between the:
				 - development group
				 - SQA group
			 - Neither group should have power over the other
			 - More senior management must decide whether to
				 - Deliver the product on time but with faults, or
				 - Test further and deliver the product late
			 - The decision must take into account the interests of the client and the development organization
	 - Non-Execution-Based Testing
		 - Underlying principles
			 - We should not review our own work
			 - Group synergy (developers and SQA)
		 - Testing software without running test cases: Carefully read through it
			 - Review software: Carefully read through it
			 - Verify all artifacts produced from each workflow for each increment
		 - Walkthroughs
			 - A walkthrough team consists of four to six members
			 - It includes representatives from
				 - The current workflow team
				 - The next workflow team
				 - The SQA team
			 - The walkthrough team is chaired by the SQA team
			 - In a walkthrough, we *detect* faults, not correct them
				 - A correction produced by a committee is likely to be of low quality
				 - the cost of a committee correction is too high
				 - Not all items flagged are actually incorrect
				 - A walkthrough should not last longer than two hours
				 - There is no time to correct faults as well
		 - Inspections
			 - Inspection Team
				 - Moderator
				 - Member of current workflow team
				 - Member of next workflow team
				 - Member of SQA team
			 - An inspection has five formal steps
				 - Overview of artifact to review
				 - Preparation of list of types found
					 - Statistics of fault types
					 - Concentrate on areas where most faults have occurred
				 - Inspection
					 - Meticulous walkthrough of artifact
				 - Rework
					 - Responsible for artifact to resolve faults
				 - Follow-up
			 -  Fault Statistics
				 -  Faults are recorded by severity
					 -  Not a Fault
					 -  Enhancement
					 -  Trivial
					 -  Minor
					 -  Major
					 -  Critical
					 -  Blocking
				 -  Assign *priorities*
				 -  Faults are recorded by fault type
				 -  For a given workflow, we compare current fault rates with those of previous products
				 -  We take action if there are disproportionate number of faults in an artifact
					 -  Redesigning from scratch is a good alternative
				 -  We carry forward fault statistics to the next workflow
					 - We may not detect all faults of particular type in the current inspection
		 -  Comparison of Inspections and Walkthroughs
			 - Walkthrough
				 - Two Step, informal process
					 - Preparation
					 - Analysis
			 - Inspection
				 - Five-step, formal process
					 - Overview
					 - Preparation
					 - Inspection
					 - Rework
					 - Follow-up
			 - Strengths and Weaknesses of Reviews
				 - Review can be effective
					 - Faults are detected early in the process
				 - Reviews are less effective if the process is inadequate
					 - Large-Scale software should consist of smaller, largely independent pieces
					 - The documentation of the previous workflows has to be complete and available online
				 - Code reviews lead to rapid and thorough fault detection
					 - Up to 95% reduction in maintenance costs
	 - Non-execution VS Execution Based Testing
		 - Non-execution based testing used when testing artifacts of the requirements, analysis, and design workflows
		 - Execution based testing applied to only the source doe of implementation workflow
		 - Non execution based testing of code (code review) has been shown to be as effective as execution-based testing (running test cases)
	 - Execution-Based Testing
		 - Organizations spend up to 50% of their software budget on testing
			 - But delivered software is frequently unreliable
		 - Testing is the process of *finding differences between the expected behavior and the observed behavior*
		 - fault detection technique that tries to create failures or erroneous states in a planned way
		 - A test is successful if it identifies faults or proves that no fault are present
		 - What should be tested?
			 - Correctness
				 - Requirement satisfaction
			 - Utility
				 - Extent to which the product meets the user's needs
					 - Ease of use, useful functionalities, cost effectiveness
			 - Reliability
				 - Measure of the frequency and criticality of failure
			 - Robustness
				 - The range of operating conditions
				 - The possibility of unacceptable results with valid input
				 - The effect of invalid input
			 - Performance
				 - Extent to which space and time constraints are met
					 - Real and Hard time constraints, data loss because software is slow
		 - Who Should Perform Execution Based Testing?
			 - Programming is constructive
			 - Testing is destructive
				 - A successful test finds a fault
				 - So, programmers should not test their own code
			 - Solution
				 - The programmer does informal testing
				 - The SQA group then does systematic testing
				 - The programmer debugs the module
			 - All test cases must be
				 - Planned beforehand, including the expected output
				 - Retained afterwards
	 - When Testing Stops
		 - Only when the product has been irrevocably discarded
