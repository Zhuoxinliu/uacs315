## Eclipse, Java, ANT, JavaDoc Lab

### Java
- Cross platform
- Object Oriented
- Architecture neutral
- Portable
- Editions
	- *Java Standard Edition (J2SE)*
		- This is the one we're going to use.
	- Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE)
	- Java Micro Editions (J2ME)
- Start with a min call.
- The main method signature should look like this:
	
	```java
	public class Example
	{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				System.out.println("Hello, world");
			}
	}
	```

- Classes can be marked
	- Abstract
	- Normal
- Attributes can be
	- Public (visible to everyone)
	- Private (visible only to the current object)
	- Protected (visible to current object and inheriting classes)
	- Static (class level variables

### Eclipse
- Used in the industry
- Is a professional Integration Development Environment
- Can be used with different languages, specialized for java
- Utilizes a plug in system.
- Uses contextual views
	- Java view
	- Debug view
	- Git perspective
	- etc

Eclipse can be used to
- Create classes and methods (normal and abstract)
- Run applications (building/cleaning)
- Debug (breakpoints, step in, over, out)
- View the Watch List

### ANT
- Another neat tool
- Similar to Make, which is used to automate builds
- Maintained by Apache
- Provides instructions on how to create, assemble and or deploy a project
- Written in XML
- Has tons of documentation and is very widely used.

The goal of ANT is **automation**.

If multiple builds are desired, you can create different versions, have different architecture targets and switch between and release builds.

### JAVADOC

- JAVADOC is documentation provided in line for classes methods and fields.
- Notation is of the form:

```java
/**
* My class description
*
* @author Jacob Zarobsky
* @version 1.0
* 
*/
public class Example
{

}
```
Can be used to create HTML documentation for code.

Different parameters

- `@author` the author
- `@return` describes what is returned
- `@param [parameter name]` describes a parameter
